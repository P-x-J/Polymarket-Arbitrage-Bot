# Polymarket's Binary Arbitrage Bot


## Project Status: Under Active Development ðŸš§

This project is currently in active development. Until it reaches a more stable release, **expect frequent and potentially breaking updates**. I'm working hard to get things polished, and your feedback is welcome!

## How does binary arbitrage work?

Letâ€™s consider this market about Kamala winning Vermont by 32 points. We would classify this as Binary because there is 1 yes and 1 no option to place a bet on. Now, the first instance of arbitrage could be within the **same** market. If we add the 72c yes and the 35c no, we get a total of **107**, indicating that there is no arbitrage opportunity here. If for example, it were 72 and 25, we would say there is a **3%** arbitrage opportunity because that total adds up to **97**. 

### Explanation:

If you owned both positions, winning the 72c bet would earn you 28c. However, you would lose 25c from the no position and be left with 3 cents **(per contract)**. Conversely, winning the 25c no bet would net you 75 cents, but you subtract 72 because you also own the 72c yes position, netting you 3 cents again. We see here that regardless of the outcome of this binary market, you are guaranteed a 3 cent profit per contract.

## How does the bot work?

The bot surfs through Polymarket's web while it's running., identifies any possible binary arbitrage opportunity and notifies the user.

## How to get started:

Istructions will be given later on, sorry for the inconvenience.

## How to contribute:

Contributions are limited while I'm constructing the project's main framework. However, any feedback or ideas are always welcomed.



## Future Updates:

In the future, we aim to expand its functionality to include working with cross-binary prediction markets, such as Kalshi, Robinhood...etc in order to catch potential arbitrage opportunities.
